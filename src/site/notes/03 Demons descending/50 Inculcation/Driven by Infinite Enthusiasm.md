# Driven by Infinite Enthusiasm

- Which lectures? (order is not strict)
	- [[03 Demons descending/50 Inculcation/Driven by Infinite Enthusiasm.Shifrin Multivariable Mathematics\|Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus by Shifrin]]
	- Linear Algebra Done Right - Sheldon Axler
		- [Book website](https://linear.axler.net/), [Third ed pdf](http://library.lol/main/FA472BC434699EFE0F9BD5DC4E2E595E)
		- [YouTube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGAnmvB9m7zOBVCZBUUmSinFV0wEir2Vw)
	- Classical Mechanics, bit of Statistical and Chaos
		- [[03 Demons descending/50 Inculcation/Driven by Infinite Enthusiasm.VBalki_Classical_Physics\|Classical Physics by Balki]]
		- (book) LandauL volume I 
		- [Non-linear dynamics by Balki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh4TFzg30eQ&list=PLbMVogVj5nJQKk1E7OUQs_TcW_zQoaO4t) 
		- (short) [Mechanics using the Action by T Paddy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFCvH2vR5kRzC1LQtHy_MUAquC-tQiiW)
	- Some math ✨ 
		- Abstract Algebra by Benedict Gross
		- Artin - Algebra
		- [A Infinitely Large Napkin](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/Napkin.pdf) - an introduction to a lots of fields of math! (NOT a textbook but a really nice book)
		- You can definitely do analysis here, its always a inculcating and ever increasing skill and knowledge-base. Jump below and find the references.
	- I DECREE: DO MORE CLASSICAL!
		- Fluid mechanics
			- If you think you know what fluid mechanis is (from school, say), I guarantee that you do not!
		- Electrodynamics
			- (book) LandauL volume II - absolute necessary for special relativity and electrodynamics, and GR
				- there’s no introduction to electrodynamics better than Paddy and LandauL
			- for more theory Griffiths, and for more pain: Jackson
			- [[Circuitry\|Circuitry]] (TODO)
		- GR
			- for properly doing GR, you’ll need a lot of pre-req, and its all super cool math! But for now a physics taste of the matter will just be smooth.
			- General Relativity and Cosmology by T Paddy
	- more math ✨ 
		- [MathHistory: A course in the History of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55C7C83781CF4316)
		- “Linear Algebra Done Right” by Sheldon Axler, Sheldon Axler’s Playlist [Linear Algebra Done Right - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGAnmvB9m7zOBVCZBUUmSinFV0wEir2Vw)
	- (only if you wanna do quantum)
		- Quantum Physics by Balki
	- Now that you see how deep things are, go back and focus on the details
		- Construct spaces and do algebra and analysis
			- Tao Analysis vol I, II
			- Apostol Mathematical Analysis
			- Rudin Analysis
		- Do more inside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
			- [[Just R n, only R n\|Just R n, only R n]] (TODO) < algebras, differential forms >
			- Differential Geometry	by Claudio Arezzo
		- Go outside of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
			- < Manifold theory >
			- [[05 Inner-core/STUDY! xx0 Physics/FredericSchuller-International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015/FredericSchuller-International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015\|FredericSchuller-International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015]]
			- [[05 Inner-core/STUDY! xx0 Physics/FredericSchuller-Lectures on the Geometric Anatomy of Theoretical Physics/FredericSchuller-Lectures on the Geometric Anatomy of Theoretical Physics\|FredericSchuller-Lectures on the Geometric Anatomy of Theoretical Physics]]
	- Apply your new-found knowledge
		- [[05 Inner-core/STUDY! 0x1 Physics/FredericSchuller-Quantum Theory/FredericSchuller-Quantum Theory\|FredericSchuller-Quantum Theory]]
		- Hamiltonian system and symplectic geometry
- How to do lectures?
	- Use https://obsidian.md to organize the amount of content/
		- Copy the lecture note 
		- Complete each lecture and tick the check box. 
	- Make lecture notes
		- in Obsidian.
			- you’ll need to learn LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
		- in physical notebook.
			- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
			- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
		- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
- Look here:

- Watch (any one or all even) these one lecture and tell me how can you not love this!! (don’t pay attention to the name of the video)
