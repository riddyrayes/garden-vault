# Driven by Infinite Enthusiasm 

- Which lectures? (order is not strict)
	- [[03 Demons descending/03 Inculcation/Driven by Infinite Enthusiasm.Shifrin Multivariable Mathematics\|Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus by Shifrin]]
	- Classical Mechanics, bit of Statistical and Chaos
		- [[03 Demons descending/03 Inculcation/Driven by Infinite Enthusiasm.VBalki_Classical_Physics\|Classical Physics by Balki]]
		- (book) LandauL volume I 
		- Non-linear dynamics by Balki
		- (short) Mechanics using the Action by T Paddy
	- Some math ✨ 
		- Abstract Algebra by Benedict Gross
		- [A Infinitely Large Napkin](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/Napkin.pdf)
	- Do more classical
		- < fluid mechanics >
		- (book) LandauL volume II - absolute necessary for special relativity and electrodynamics, and GR
		- there’s no introduction to electrodynamics better than Paddy and LandauL
			- for more theory Griffiths, Jackson(F)
		- General Relativity and Cosmology by T Paddy
	- (if you wanna do quantum)
		- Quantum Physics by Balki
	- Now that you see how deep things are, go back and focus on the details
		- Construct spaces and do algebra and analysis
			- Tao Analysis vol I, II
			- Apostol Mathematical Analysis
			- Rudin Analysis
		- Do more inside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
			- < algebras, differential forms >
			- Differential Geometry	by Claudio Arezzo
		- Go outside of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
			- < Manifold theory >
			- [[04 2204 Inner-core/STUDY! xx0 Physics/FredericSchuller-International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015/FredericSchuller-International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015\|FredericSchuller-International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015]]
			- [[04 2204 Inner-core/STUDY! xx0 Physics/FredericSchuller-Lectures on the Geometric Anatomy of Theoretical Physics/FredericSchuller-Lectures on the Geometric Anatomy of Theoretical Physics\|FredericSchuller-Lectures on the Geometric Anatomy of Theoretical Physics]]
	- Apply your new-found knowledge
		- [[04 2204 Inner-core/STUDY! 0x1 Physics/FredericSchuller-Quantum Theory/FredericSchuller-Quantum Theory\|FredericSchuller-Quantum Theory]]
		- Hamiltonian system and symplectic geometry
- How to do lectures?
	- Use https://obsidian.md to organize the amount of content/
		- Copy the lecture note 
		- Complete each lecture and tick the check box. 
	- Make lecture notes
		- in Obsidian.
			- you’ll need to learn LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
		- in physical notebook.
			- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
			- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
		- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
