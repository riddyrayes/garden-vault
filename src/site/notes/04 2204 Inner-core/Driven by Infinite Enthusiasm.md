# Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus 

<iframe width="650" height="415" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL5I-Eyk8l9FHdJUd9UujGcvumjCFPHbrd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This fairly rigorous but very entertaining set of lectures (where the instructor uses blackboard!) explains all the stuff in Multivariable calculus one encounters during the core years of a Fundamental Sciences programme: multiple derivatives, _volumous_ integrals, change of coordinates, and especially does everything in a proper linear algebraic setting (which becomes very important in the long run) and with lots of examples and pictures!

## Outline

> This two-semester class is a theoretical and more challenging amalgamation ... Proofs of theorems and additional physical applications will be stressed, and harder computational problems will be included.

The set of lectures is actually a two semester course, with mixed together description of various methods in Linear algebra and Calculus in ℝⁿ.
   ### First semester

## Instructor’s description

This is an integrated year-long course in multivariable calculus and linear algebra. It includes all the material in MATH 2270/2500 and MATH 3000, along with additional applications and theoretical material. There is greater emphasis on proofs, and the pace is quick. Typically the class consists of a blend of sophomores and freshmen who've earned a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam. The text is my book, [Multivariable Mathematics: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Manifolds](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047152638X.html).

Students who would like some guidance in reading and writing proofs might want to look at a wonderful new book called [How to Think Like a Mathematician: A Companion to Undergraduate Mathematics](http://library.lol/main/E46132BF2DB1C18E7E309CBF5A92A636), by Kevin Houston, Cambridge University Press, 2009.
